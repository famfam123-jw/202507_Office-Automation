## Notes

- Both programs use a graphical user interface (GUI). When you run the scripts, a window should open.
- **For Naver News Monitoring**, your own Naver API credentials are required.
- **For OCR extraction**, make sure Tesseract is installed and the Korean language pack (`kor.traineddata`) is present for accurate Hangul recognition.
- If sharing the project publicly, **do not upload your personal API keys or secrets to GitHub!**
